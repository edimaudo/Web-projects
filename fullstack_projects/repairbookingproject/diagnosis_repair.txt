 Diagnosis and repair booking system 

 ---------------------------------------------

 1. There are two types of bookings: “diagnosis and repair” and “scheduled maintenance”. Each is handled differently but they share common features. Diagnosis refers to the act of finding a reported fault in a vehicle and repair refers to the act of fixing that fault. The fixing of a fault may require a repair to a part on the vehicle or the ordering and installation of a new, working, part.

 2. Repairs are carried out by a single mechanic (a class of employee of the garage) whose hours spent on the repair are recorded. Each mechanic has a fixed hourly costing rate.

 3. Each repair booking is of variable time duration.

 4. The opening hours of the garage are Mon-Fri 9am to 5.30pm and Sat 9am-12 noon.

 5. The garage is not open on public and bank holidays.

 6. Appointments can only be made in the future.

 7. Current mileage of the vehicle must be recorded during the diagnosis and repair booking.

 8. The system user should be able to query the system to get a list of bookings with customer and vehicle details and next booking date. They should be able to add, edit and delete bookings directly from this list.

 9. For each vehicle, the system user should be able to access lists of past and future booking dates, customer name and type of booking

 10. When deleting a booking a confirmation shall be required.

 11. It will be necessary to easily view and edit bookings such that lists of bookings can be viewed and edited on an hourly, daily and monthly basis.

 12. The user should be able to search for a booking by partial or full vehicle registration number, vehicle manufacturer or customer surname and firstname.
