I am looking for people who have already developed "An Tourist Recommendation System". 
It should be a web application. 
The basic idea of the application should be the following User Section: 
1) A login page will appear initially and the user has to log in to continue 
2) If the user is new he/she will have to fill the registration form (username, password, email, first name, last name, etc.) the current location of the user is obtained by the use of GPS. 
3) These details will be submitted to an online database. 
4) After logging in, the user will get a screen with 2 tabs. 
	Tab 1 : 1. it will contain a set of questionnaire to which the user has to reply using radio buttons. 	2. Based on the answer provided by the user, an intelligent tree algorithm will run and 1-3 best results will be provided from the online database 
	3.Clicking on each result will provide the user with the description of spots/locations along with the pictures. The user will also have the option to view the exact location of the spot on Google map 
	
	Tab 2: 1. This section allows user to make a manual search for various tourist locations by country, city area, name of the place. 

	Admin Dashboard: Admin can operate the system from a web application through his browser. 
	The system also consists of an admin dashboard where the admin can log in and enter places into the database with images, information, location, and position on maps. Also, the admin can add edit the questionnaire for the user to fill.
