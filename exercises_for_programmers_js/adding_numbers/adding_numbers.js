/*
Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the total of the numbers.

The prompting must use repetition, such as a counted loop, not three separate prompts.

Modify theprogram to prompt for how many numbers to add, instead of hard-coding the value. Be sure you convert the input to a number before doing the compar- ison.
â€¢ Modify the program so that it only adds numbers and silently rejects non-numeric values. Count these invalid entries as attempts anyway. In other words, if the number of numbers to add is 5, your program should still prompt only five times.
