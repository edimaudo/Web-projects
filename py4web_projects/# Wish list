# Wish list

The scope of your application covers the following use cases:

The user views the wish list of a person.
The user registers as a new wisher.
The user logs in and creates her/his wish list.
The user logs in and edits his/her wish list.
To cover this basic functionality, you will need to implement the following PHP files:

The "front" page index.php for logging in, registering, and switching to wish lists of other users.
The wishlist page for viewing the wish list of a particular wisher.
The createNewWisher page for registering as a wisher.
The editWishList page for editing a wish list by its owner.
The editWish page for creating and editing wishes.
